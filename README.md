# JSBall
## Author: Nellie Tobey

A remake of the classic Desktop game Jezzball using Vanilla JavaScript

Desktop version
Easy level 1 only for now

## rules

1) use the left mouse to start the dividing wall
2) if the ball touches the dividing wall before it has reached the ends you lose a life
3) use the right mouse button to change the direction you would like the wall to move
4) There is no win mechanism, but it is possible to reduce the grid to only one square if you time it right
5) Game is over if you lose all three lives

## TODO
0) Lint the JavaScript
1) It's not pretty, make it pretty
2) add complexity with more levels, and more balls that bounce about 
3) With more levels, move automatically to new levels once they have cleared a minimum of a specified amount of squares.
